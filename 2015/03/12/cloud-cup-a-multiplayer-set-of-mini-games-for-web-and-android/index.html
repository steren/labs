    <p>I’m glad to present the work of a week-long hackathon I did last November with three other googlers.</p>
    <p>I’ve been having for a long time the idea of a real time game using phones as controller and a big screen as the main game screen. You may recall a previous blog post about a <a href="../../../../2011/09/15/anydance/index.html">first prototype</a>. A few years later, I could pitch the idea at an internal hackathon and gather a team around the concept. While I initially wanted to build a dancing game, I realized that this was <a href="http://www.justdancenow.com/">already done</a>, so we decided to go towards mini games, an idea very compatible with a hackathon timeframe.</p>
    <p>Realizing after a day that we would not be able to have a reliable and scalable real time architecture and a fun game after just five days using regular backend technologies, we decided to focus on the game itself and to use <a href="https://www.firebase.com">Firebase</a> to handle the real time and backend parts of our system. It allowed us to get familiar with this very interesting technology. I already <a href="../../../../2014/05/05/indoor-climbing-tracker/index.html">used Parse in the past</a>, while they both fall into the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_Backend_as_a_service">Backend as a Service (MBaaS) category</a>, I could notice with pleasure that Firebase was able to perform as well as Parse for the regular MBaaS features (and even better to my taste, by providing an <a href="https://www.firebase.com/docs/web/libraries/angular/index.html">Angukar</a> SDK) but that it also provides impressive real time capabilities.</p>
    <p>After a single day, we had a functional prototype of our game: Android phones were interacting in real time with an Angular application in a “Shake” game. The next three days were spent creating other mini games and streamlining the game mechanism.</p>
    <p>And we won the Fun category!</p>
    <p>While the hackathon was internal, it was not a problem at all for Google to let us open source and release our work to the public. You can find the sources on GitHub: <a href="https://github.com/google/cloud-cup-android">Android</a> and <a href="https://github.com/google/cloud-cup">Web</a>. Firebase <a href="https://www.firebase.com/blog/2015-03-11-cloud-cup-cross-platform-demo.html">showcased the project</a> on its official blog.</p>
    <p><strong>Try it now: <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=fr.steren.cloudcup">Install the Android app</a></strong>, and visit <strong><a href="https://cloud-cup.firebaseapp.com">cloudcup.firebaseapp.com</a></strong> to start a game.</p>
    <p>I hope you like it.</p>
