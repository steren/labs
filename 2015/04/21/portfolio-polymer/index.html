    <p>I wanted to give a try to <a href="http://webcomponents.org/" target="_blank">web components</a>, that I think will change the way people create and share UI elements on the web. I chose <a href="https://www.polymer-project.org/" target="_blank">Polymer</a>, a framework that embraces web components and makes them easy to use. And when I want to get familiar with a new web frontend technology, I just rewrite my personal website with it (last time was <a href="../../../../2013/09/25/angularjs-portfolio-website/index.html" target="_blank">Angular</a>).</p>
    <p>See it live at <a href="http://steren.fr/" target="_blank">steren.fr</a>, get the <a href="https://github.com/steren/steren.github.com" target="_blank">code on GitHub</a>, and compare it to <a href="https://github.com/steren/steren.github.com/tree/angular" target="_blank">the previous Angular version</a>.</p>
    <p>Polymer contains many things :</p>
    <ul>
      <li>A <a href="https://www.polymer-project.org/docs/start/platform.html" target="_blank">set of browser polyfills</a>, to enable new browser technologies that are not yet entirely supported by moderns browsers: shadow DOM, templates, HTML imports.</li>
      <li>The <a href="https://www.polymer-project.org/docs/polymer/polymer.html" target="_blank">Polymer library</a>, that is an opinionated way to define and use web components.</li>
      <li>The <a href="https://www.polymer-project.org/docs/elements/core-elements.html#core-ajax" target="_blank">core Polymer elements</a> which provide basic new UI elements and tools without imposing any specific look and feel.</li>
      <li>The <a href="https://www.polymer-project.org/docs/elements/paper-elements.html#paper-button" target="_blank">Paper Polymer elements</a>, that are an implementation, still incomplete, of the <a href="http://www.google.com/design/spec/material-design/introduction.html" target="_blank">Material Design guidelines</a>.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Each of these points depends on the points above it. I built the portfolio relying on the Paper elements, and thus, on the full Polymer stack.</p>

    <p><strong>Responsive</strong>: The layout of the portfolio is responsive: on mobile, the menu is inside a navigation drawer, on a larger browser, it is displayed on the left. This behaviour came put of the box by using the <a href="https://www.polymer-project.org/0.5/docs/elements/core-drawer-panel.html">core-drawer-panel</a> element.</p>

    <p><strong>UI elements:</strong> I used many of the Paper elements to build the parts of the UI: A <a href="https://www.polymer-project.org/0.5/docs/elements/core-drawer-panel.html" target="_blank">Navigation drawer</a>, <a href="https://www.polymer-project.org/0.5/docs/elements/paper-tabs.html" target="_blank">tabs</a>, <a href="https://www.polymer-project.org/0.5/docs/elements/core-icon.html" target="_blank">icons</a>, <a href="https://www.polymer-project.org/0.5/docs/elements/core-header-panel.html" target="_blank">header</a>… And as in the previous <a title="My Portfolio written with AngularJS" href="../../../../2013/09/25/angularjs-portfolio-website/index.html">Angular version</a>, the content is a set of cards, except that this time, a card is defined by <a href="https://github.com/steren/steren.github.com/blob/master/steren-card.html">a custom element</a>, which make the DOM very clean and meaningful. Also each of these card tag is receiving the style from the Material Design card specification.</p>
    <p><strong>Data service</strong>: A custom element is also used as a data service: it encapsulates fetching the content from a JSON file, using a Polymer helper (the <a href="https://www.polymer-project.org/0.5/docs/elements/core-ajax.html">core-ajax</a>). While at first it may sounds strange and unfamiliar to fetch a JSON data resource using only an HTML tag, for simple cases I actually think it is a good idea: It reinforces the declarative way of building a page, by declaring its resources in the HTML, not in JS.</p>
    <p><strong>Filtering and sorting</strong>: Filtering and sorting of the cards based on their attributes is also done using Polymer’s data binding and filtering, very similar to filters in AngularJS (see the <a href="https://github.com/steren/steren.github.com/blob/master/steren-work-list.html">work list component</a>). UI elements for filters were available in the <a href="https://www.polymer-project.org/0.5/components/paper-elements/demo.html">paper elements library</a> and helpers (like <a href="https://www.polymer-project.org/0.5/docs/elements/core-selector.html">core-selector</a>) exists to ease the extraction and binding of their values.</p>
    <p><strong>Routing:</strong> At the time of writing, Polymer does not provide a routing framework: you cannot bind a state of the URL to a given view state. But because of its design, I could easily combine it with other routing microframework: <a href="https://github.com/visionmedia/page.js">page.js</a>.</p>
    <p><strong>Layout helpers:</strong> Centering things has never been that easy with Polymer: the framework is providing <a href="https://www.polymer-project.org/0.5/docs/polymer/layout-attrs.html">CSS layout attributes</a>, that allow you to center something vertically or horizontally by adding just one class.</p>
    <p>
      <strong>My first impressions</strong>
    </p>
    <p>After building this simple app, what do I think about Polymer? I really believe custom elements are ideal for adding a fully functional and autonomous UI element in an app without worrying about its dependencies or its its compatibility with your code or its API: you simply import the element and use it as any other HTML element. <strong>The DOM is the API</strong>. This is really great, it’s like if the DOM was designed from the beginning to allow this interoperability of UI elements.</p>
    <p>However, I feel that building an app only with Polymer forces you to use custom elements too much. Sometimes, what I needed is not a fully isolated element represented as one tag in my HTML, but just a view, that can easily be styled using the global CSS. Because of this, I’m not sure Polymer is designed or should be used as a full featured client side framework.</p>
    <p>I think it is really ideal to share and use custom elements and to add data binding capabilities to webpages. I would probably like it to focus on this role and make sure to be compatible with other popular web front-end framework like Angular, letting them handle the app state and complex controllers and services.</p>
