Very often, I’m not. Yet, time is displayed very big on the unlock screen and is always visible at the top.</p><p>When using my smartphone and when I don’t want to explicitly check the time,  I don’t pay any attention to the clock. It can be similar to the “<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banner_blindness">banner blindness</a>” phenomenon.</p><p>What if the time could be printed into my mind without doing any effort?</p><p>I wanted to experiment around this idea. In a short time, I created a live wallpaper for Android which color changes over the hour.</p><figure data-shortcode="caption" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-285"><a href="../../screen-color.png"><img title="screen-color" src="../../screen-color.png%3Fw=300&amp;h=250" alt=""/></a><figcaption>The wallpaper color changes during the hour.</figcaption></figure><p>I’m sure that after having checked the smartphone, we are able to tell what color was the background. And because a given color corresponds to a given number of minutes, we can approximately guess the time. The tint of the background color depends on the minutes : 0 min is red (0°), 30 min is turquoise (180°)… I think that the hour is not important, most of the time, we are able to guess the hour.<br/>
Of course, it requires a learning time. A time for our brain to learn the bijection between colors and minutes. This experiment will test if it is easily possible.</p><figure data-shortcode="caption" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-294"><a href="../../colocclock-howto.png"><img title="ColocClock-howto" src="../../colocclock-howto.png%3Fw=300&amp;h=300" alt=""/></a><figcaption>The HSV color wheel is mapped on a clock. Every color has its minute.</figcaption></figure><p>Give it a try by downloading <a href="https://market.android.com/details?id=fr.steren.colorclock">“Color Clock Wallpaper” from the Android market.</a><br/><img src="http://qrcode.kaywa.com/img.php?s=6&amp;d=market%3A%2F%2Fsearch%3Fq%3Dfr.steren.colorclock" alt="qrcode"/><br/>
And it’s open-source! You can <a href="https://github.com/Steren/ColorClock">grab the code on my github</a> and come up with your own additions.</p><p>I will start using it every day, and see if this experimentation works. It may require to be tweaked, we will see.<br/>
I also have ideas for additional features:</p><ul><li>Add a texture to the wallpaper, for it to be pretty.</li><li>I notice I like to tap on the screen when I have the “Nexus” wallpaper, because I know it will do something entertaining. What if this something could make me know the time?</li><li>Let the user choose the color gradient ?</li></ul>And you, what do you think? Did you test it? Leave your comments here.</article>
