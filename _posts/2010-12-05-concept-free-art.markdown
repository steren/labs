It's been a while since I want to dive a little into generative graphics. I never had the chance to use [processing](http://processing.org/) for a project for example.

I found that [Aza Raskin](http://www.azarask.in) [ported](http://www.azarask.in/blog/post/contextfreejs-algorithm-ink-making-art-with-javascript/) some time ago [Concept Free Art](http://www.contextfreeart.org/) to javascript. I was curious about this concept of only-recursive drawings. As everything recursive, a few lines of code can produce something very complicated.

As a conclusion, I played with it some time, but I really think it's too  limited. In the end, all the drawings end by being either growing  trees, fractals or tiles.

Here are some results of my exploration (You can re-generate the drawings by clicking the "code" link):
