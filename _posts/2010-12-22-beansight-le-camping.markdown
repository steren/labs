_As this is major news for my projects, I cross-posted this article on my [main blog](http://blog.steren.fr/)._

Great news for [Beansight](http://www.beansight.com/): we have been selected to be part of [Le Camping](http://www.lecamping.org/). Le Camping is the first French tech startup accelerator program from [Silicon Sentier](http://siliconsentier.org/).

Beginning January the 4th, we will be working everyday with [11 other startups](http://us1.campaign-archive.com/?u=f98c0eea1590f1afbc8245608&id=2f54860350&e=3aebb8d22e) at the prestigious [Palais Brongniart](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palais_Brongniart). We will be mentored by great mentors that have many different backgrounds (entrepreneurs & CEOs, tech, marketing, designers...)
Only 12 teams out of 164 have been selected to be part of the adventure. I think it is a great opportunity for us to be part of the program.

Because we now have a somewhat working platform our first work will be to polish the edges of our user experience and to focus on our core algorithm. I think we can expect an initial release at the end of January.
