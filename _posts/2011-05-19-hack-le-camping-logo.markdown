We are organizing a developper event for the end of June in Paris. Read more about the event [here](http://hacklecamping.eventbrite.com/).

I took some time to create a logo, and here is the second iteration :

In the spirit of a hacking event, the logo is a remix of [Le Camping](http://lecamping.org/)'s logo. Then the idea is that people will build things on top of the APIs from startups of Le Camping, this is why Le Camping's symbol is the root of a growing tree of smaller other symbols. And of course, the [Van Koch fractal](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Koch_snowflake) is something geeks love :)

What do you think?

It's done using [Inkscape](http://inkscape.org/) an Open Source vector graphics editor I contributed to. It uses Live Path Effects. Get the SVG [here](https://github.com/Steren/hacklecamping-logo/blob/master/Hack_LeCamping.svg)!

Now let's do the t-shirts !
