If like me you are fed up with the cluttered interface of the main French train ticket website [voyages-sncf.com](http://www.voyages-sncf.com/), I advise you to try [Capitaine Train](http://www.capitainetrain.com/), a startup that sells tickets too but re-invented the interface and is **doing it right**.

However, if you still want to use voyages-sncf.com for whatever reason, you can install this little hack I made by removing everything not necessary to me:

**How to use it:**
Install the _Stylish_ add-on for [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/stylish/) or [Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/fjnbnpbmkenffdnngjfgmeleoegfcffe), then install my style from [this page](http://userstyles.org/styles/60657/voyages-sncf-com-focus-on-train-tickets). Enjoy.

The simple "source code" is available on this [gist](https://gist.github.com/1783590), feel free to make it better.

This could be a message to SNCF: Keep It Simple Stupid, please.
