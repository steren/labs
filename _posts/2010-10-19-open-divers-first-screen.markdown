After a few days of work, I now have a first version of the project. Here are some screen captures:

[gallery link="file" order="DESC"]

Basically I've got the dive and spot system working. Other entities (such as trips, divers, diving centers) are here but we cannot interact with them yet.

I'm very sorry but you cannot try it yet, the structure may evolve and you would be disappointed if all your data were lost.

I spent time talking with divers and gathering feedback from you, readers. Thanks again.

As I said before, I will now pause this project for a week, to focus on [Beansight](http://www.beansight.com/). A post with technical details is coming.
