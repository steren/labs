I followed [Bob Ross](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Ross)'s technique in this first attempt at painting. If you do not know Bob Ross, check the [official Youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/BobRossInc) it's so relaxing. After watching a few episodes, I became familiar a few techniques and gave it a try.

Here is my composition, featuring the usual cloudy sky, snowy mountains, a lake and happy little trees:![bob-ross-steren](https://sterenlabs.files.wordpress.com/2016/01/bob-ross-steren.jpg)

I got quite good comments from the [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/HappyTrees/comments/3wnuw2/my_first_attempt_sky_mountain_lake_and_evergreen/) community.
