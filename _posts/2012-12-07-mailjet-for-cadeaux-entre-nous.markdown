My old website "[Cadeaux entre nous](http://www.cadeaux-entre-nous.fr/)" is seeing a large traffic during the christmass season:



	
  * around 2000 events were created during the last 2 months

	
  * between 500 and 1000 people visit the site each day.


This naturally lead to a mailing issue: I was previously using gmail to automatically send emails, I guess I reached the limit since it constantly required me to change the password.

I recently heard about [MailJet](http://www.cadeaux-entre-nous.fr/), a French company that [raised quite a lot of money](http://frenchweb.fr/exclusif-la-plateforme-de-cloud-emailing-mailjet-leve-2-5-millions-euros/88793) last week. I knew [Sendgrid](http://sendgrid.com/) but was willing to try something fresh.

Mailjet has a nice UI, clear instructions and allows you to setup your SMTP server in a few clicks. The real-time dashboard with analytics is a real plus to see if everything goes well.

I quickly reached the free plans limit (which is 200 mails per day), but thanks to a few [donations from my users](http://cadeaux-entre-nous.fr/faq), I could upgrade a Bronze plan and since then, all is runnign smoothly. I guess I will downgrade when the holiday season is over.
