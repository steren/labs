A friend of mine is working on two or three documentaries about marine life. He is a very passionate diver and really loves to share his passion. You can watch his previous videos on his [Dailymotion Channel](http://www.dailymotion.com/franckfranck2A#videoId=xkvg95).

His first trip is to the Maldives, where he will be filming Manta Rays. I worked using [Blender](http://www.blender.org/) on a shot that explains the travel and the location.

You can see on the following video, various iterations of this shot:
